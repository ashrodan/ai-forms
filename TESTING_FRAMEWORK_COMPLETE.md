```

### 🎪 Test Fixtures & Models

**Comprehensive Test Models:**
- `simple_user_model` - Basic 3-field model for core testing
- `complex_job_model` - Advanced model with dependencies, skip conditions, clusters
- `empty_model` - Edge case testing with no fields
- `circular_dependency_model` - Error condition testing
- Parametrized fixtures for all enums and modes

**Real-World Test Scenarios:**
- User registration workflows
- Job application with conditional logic  
- Medical intake forms with sensitivity
- Survey forms with various question types
- Event registration with complex rules
- Customer onboarding processes

### 🔍 Test Coverage Areas
