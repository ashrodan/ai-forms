# Pydantic AI Integration Plan
                                           
 Phase 1: Core Integration (High Priority) 
                                           
 1. Update Dependencies                    
 - Add pydantic-ai>=0.0.12 to              
 pyproject.toml core dependencies          
 - Add pydantic-ai[test] to dev            
 dependencies for testing utilities        
                                           
 2. Create AI-Powered Question Generator   
 - New PydanticAIQuestionGenerator class   
 using Agent with result_type=str          
 - System prompt for conversational form   
 interactions                              
 - Context integration using agent         
 dependencies                              
 - Fallback to DefaultQuestionGenerator    
 for reliability                           
                                           
 3. Add AI Response Parser

 models as result_type                     
 - Handle complex types (lists, nested     
 objects) that current parser can't        
 - Graceful fallback to current            
 string-based parsing                      
                                           
 4. Testing Infrastructure

  responses                                
 - Test AI question generation quality     
 - Test AI parsing accuracy                
 - Add performance benchmarks for AI calls 
                                           
 Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Medium        
 Priority)                                 
                                           
 5. Context-Aware Conversations            
 - Update form flow to pass collected data 
  to AI generator                          
 - Implement personalized question         
 generation                                
 - Add conversation memory and follow-up   
 questions                                 
 - Test dynamic questioning based on       
 previous responses                        
                                           
 6. Advanced Error Handling                
 - AI-powered validation error             
 explanations                              
 - Conversational recovery from parsing    
 failures                                  
 - Multi-turn clarification for ambiguous  
 responses                                 
 - Test error scenarios with AI assistance 
                                           
 Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Future)   
                                           
 7. Intelligent Form Flow                  
 - Dynamic field ordering based on         
 conversation context                      
 - Skip condition evaluation using AI      
 reasoning

 grouping                                  
 - Test complex conversation flows         
                                           
 8. Multi-Provider Support

 providers                                 
 - Provider fallback strategies            
 - Cost optimization and rate limiting     
 - Test provider switching and error       
 handling                                  
                                           
 Key Implementation Details                
                                           
 - Backward Compatibility: Keep

 - Configuration: Add AI settings to form  
 configuration                             
 - Testing: Extensive TestModel usage for  
 reliable CI/CD
